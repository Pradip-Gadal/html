            we are in lever 3 now in this level we are going to study about semantic and non-semantic tags.
            Header, main, footer are the semantic and div, span are non-semantic tags. It is necessary to understand for SEO.
            For header tags there are three core tags article tags, section tags and aside tags:
            <b>Article:</b>
            It is used for writing artical in a page.
            <b>Section:</b>
            It is used to write some section of the html code.
            <b>Aside:</b>
            It is used to write the code which doesn't affect during SEO. It will be ignored such as ads. on the page.
