<!--This is my first html tutorial-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--<html> is the root of html document-->
<!--It has two children <head> and <body>-->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>first page</title>
<!--<head> doesn't shows in page but considered as non showing content-->
</head>
<body>
<!--<body> is higlight part in web page, which contains all tags-->
   <!-- <h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<h4>,<h5>,<h6> are the heading tag-->
<h1>heading 1</h1>
<h2>heading 2</h2>
<h3>heading 3</h3>
<h4>heading 4</h4>
